## Spread Operator

code snippets

spread operator works on all iterables and objects. such as

-Arrays
-Maps
-Sets
-Strings
-Objects //remember objects are not iterable.

note: in Javascript Objects are not iterable, unless they implement iterable protocols.

Spread operator cannot be used inside template literal. because template literal variable does not expect multiple values
